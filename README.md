# From Humble Beginnings - My Very First Coding Experience

The files contained within this repository are an example of the first programming experience I ever had. C++ was the very first language I learned and
serves as the foundation to all my additional coding skills. This work was done during a Computer Science course as part of my Data Science curriculum
at the University of Colorado Boulder and was simultaneously one of the most difficult and enjoyable classes I have ever had the pleasure of 
participating in. I spent much of my time dveloping these scripts in the computer science lab on campus, where I spent almost my every waking moment
that semester, admittedly struggling through the most basic of concepts. However, after the completion of this course and the development of the scripts
you see attached, my passion for programming grew exponentially until it could not be contained. While many of these concepts gave me trouble at first,
I can happily say that they are now well-defined tools within my workbelt. My favorite project done here was that of the "capitilization" script.
The goal for this was to create a function that would take various strings and arrays, changing the characters to all-caps. This project alone took a
solid 2 hour of work at a time when my experience was limited but would serve as a foundation to my future success. Through it I learned to loop through
individual characters, create temporary arrays that I could append to, and increase ASCII values (my first exposure to the ASCII sytem). In hindsight,
these tasks were far from complex, however, I include it in my portfolio as an example of humble beginnings and because it served to rapidly decrease
my time to learning Python. In Python, this same 2 hours task takes less then 5 seconds with the in-library member function ".upper()". I like to look
back on these beginnings because, would I have learned python first, I would have no idea the mechanisms occuring in the background that enable the
".upper()" function to exist. Fortunately enough, this course taught me the fundamentals of manipulating a computer and speaking in its language,
ultimately giving me a great appreciation for the continued evolvement of programming languages and the people involved.
